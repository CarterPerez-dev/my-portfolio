  "description": "Every Python package needs a pyproject.toml. If you lint with ruff, type check with mypy, format with yapf, and publish to PyPI, you end up copying the same 200 line config file every time you start something new. This just generates it. Run pps init, pick a preset, and you get a pyproject.toml with all the tool configs already there. Also spits out a GitHub Actions workflow for PyPI trusted publishing if you want it.\n\nOpinionated to how I set up projects, but it's open source so use it or fork it. If nothing else, maybe you'll discover uv from the README because there's genuinely no reason to use pip anymore.",
  "technical_details": "Three presets: fastapi-backend (async SQLAlchemy, JWT, the whole stack), library (no runtime deps), and cli-tool (Typer + Rich). Each comes with ruff, mypy, pylint, pytest, coverage, and ty configs including per-file-ignores for test directories and mypy overrides for common edge cases. Uses tomli-w for TOML serialization instead of string templating. Interactive mode with Rich prompts or full CLI flags for scripting.",
